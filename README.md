# Impact of Workplace Stress on Employee Mental Health

## Overview
This project analyzes how modern work arrangements—remote, hybrid, and onsite—impact employee mental health, stress levels, and work-life balance. Using a dataset of 5,000 employees from diverse industries, we explore correlations between factors like sleep quality, physical activity, meeting fatigue, and mental health outcomes. The goal is to identify actionable insights that organizations can implement to foster healthier, more productive workplaces.

## Key Research Questions
- How do sleep quality and physical activity affect stress levels?
- Are certain industries or job roles more prone to mental health challenges?
- How do stress levels vary across remote, hybrid, and onsite work models?
- What demographic and work pattern trends affect work-life balance and wellness?
